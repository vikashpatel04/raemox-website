# The Future of RISC-V in Edge AI

The embedded systems landscape is shifting. While ARM has dominated for decades, RISC-V is emerging as a compelling alternative for edge AI applications.

## What is RISC-V?

RISC-V is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike ARM, there are no licensing fees.

## Why RISC-V for Edge AI?

### 1. Custom Extensions

RISC-V allows custom instruction extensions, enabling:
- Matrix multiplication accelerators
- Custom quantization operations
- Domain-specific optimizations

### 2. No Licensing Costs

For high-volume edge devices, ARM licensing adds up. RISC-V eliminates this cost entirely.

### 3. Growing Ecosystem

Major players are investing heavily:
- SiFive's AI accelerators
- Esperanto Technologies
- Alibaba's Xuantie series

## Current Limitations

- Toolchain maturity still catching up
- Fewer pre-optimized libraries
- Limited silicon availability

## Our Perspective

At RaeMox, we're actively experimenting with RISC-V platforms. For certain edge AI workloads, the performance-per-dollar is already competitive.

The next 5 years will be transformative for RISC-V in edge computing.
